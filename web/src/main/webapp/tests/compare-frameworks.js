üé≠ Puppeteer vs Playwright Comparison Demo
==========================================

üìå SIMILARITIES:
- Both can automate Chromium-based browsers
- Similar API for basic operations (click, type, navigate)
- Both support screenshots, PDF generation
- Both can intercept network requests

üìå KEY DIFFERENCES:

1. BROWSER SUPPORT:
   ‚Ä¢ Puppeteer: Primarily Chrome/Chromium
   ‚Ä¢ Playwright: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge

2. API DESIGN:
   ‚Ä¢ Puppeteer: page.click('selector')
   ‚Ä¢ Playwright: page.click('selector') + auto-waiting

3. SELECTORS:
   ‚Ä¢ Puppeteer: CSS selectors, XPath
   ‚Ä¢ Playwright: CSS, XPath, text, role, test-id

4. WAIT STRATEGIES:
   ‚Ä¢ Puppeteer: Explicit waits needed often
   ‚Ä¢ Playwright: Smart auto-waiting built-in

5. MOBILE TESTING:
   ‚Ä¢ Puppeteer: Basic viewport changes
   ‚Ä¢ Playwright: Full device emulation

6. PARALLEL EXECUTION:
   ‚Ä¢ Puppeteer: Manual setup required
   ‚Ä¢ Playwright: Built-in parallel support

7. DEBUGGING:
   ‚Ä¢ Puppeteer: headless: false, slowMo
   ‚Ä¢ Playwright: Inspector, trace viewer, video recording

üìä WHEN TO USE EACH:

USE PUPPETEER WHEN:
‚úì Working only with Chrome
‚úì Need direct Chrome DevTools Protocol access
‚úì Existing Puppeteer codebase
‚úì Simple automation tasks

USE PLAYWRIGHT WHEN:
‚úì Need cross-browser testing
‚úì Want better debugging tools
‚úì Need mobile device emulation
‚úì Want auto-waiting features
‚úì Building new test suites

üöÄ Running the demos:
- Puppeteer: npm run test:puppeteer -- login-demo.test.js
- Playwright: npm run test:playwright -- login-demo.spec.ts
