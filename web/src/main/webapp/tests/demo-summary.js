- tests/e2e/1-playwright-login-page.png
- tests/e2e/2-playwright-before-submit.png  
- tests/e2e/4-playwright-mobile-view.png
- tests/e2e/trace.zip (Playwright debug trace)

ðŸŽ¯ Key Takeaways from the Demo:

1. EASE OF USE:
   â€¢ Playwright: Auto-waiting, better error messages
   â€¢ Puppeteer: More manual work required

2. DEBUGGING:
   â€¢ Playwright: Built-in trace viewer (trace.zip)
   â€¢ Puppeteer: Screenshots and console.log

3. API DIFFERENCES:
   Playwright:
   - await page.fill('input', 'text')  // Auto-clears
   - await page.click('button:has-text("Submit")')  // Advanced selectors
   
   Puppeteer:
   - await page.click('input', {clickCount: 3})  // Manual clear
   - await page.type('input', 'text')
   - await page.click('button[type="submit"]')  // CSS only

4. FEATURES DEMONSTRATED:
   âœ“ Page navigation
   âœ“ Form filling
   âœ“ Screenshots
   âœ“ Network interception
   âœ“ Mobile viewport testing
   âœ“ Multiple browser contexts (Playwright)
   âœ“ PDF generation (Puppeteer)

ðŸ“Š RECOMMENDATION:
For your TMS project, Playwright offers:
- Better debugging with trace files
- More reliable tests with auto-waiting
- Cross-browser support (test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Built-in test runner with parallel execution

ðŸš€ Next Steps:
1. View the screenshots to see the tests in action
2. Open trace.zip with: npx playwright show-trace tests/e2e/trace.zip
3. Choose your preferred framework based on your needs

Happy Testing! ðŸŽ‰
