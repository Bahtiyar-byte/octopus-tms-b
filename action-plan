ðŸ“‹ Next Action Plan

  Based on the modular architecture and current state, here's my recommended completion order:

  Phase 1: Core Authentication & User Management âœ…

  - Login/Logout functionality
  - JWT authentication
  - User Profile page

    - Load status tracking
  2. Carrier Matching

    - Carrier search and filtering
    - Rate negotiation interface
    - Broker-Carrier communication (call/email simulation)
  3. Dashboard Metrics
    - Real KPI data from backend
    - Revenue charts with actual data
    - Load volume analytics

  Phase 3: Shipper Module

  Immediate Next Steps:
